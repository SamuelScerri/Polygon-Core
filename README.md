# Libraries Used:
  - Numpy: For Fast Matrix Multiplication & Pixel Copying Instructions
  - Numba: For Caching & Compiling Functions To Increase Performance
  - PyGame: For Displaying The Screen Buffer & To Receive Input

# Current Features:
  - Barycentric Triangle Rasterization
  - Texture Mapping Support
  - Depth Buffer Support
  - Wavefront OBJ Support
  - Additive Color Mixing For Triangles

# Features That Will Be Added:
